⅓ cup chopped salted peanuts
3 tablespoons chopped cilantro

 Place the noodles in a bowl and cover with cold water. Let sit for 1 hour.

 Lightly steam the broccoli and carrot; set aside.
 
 step 2
 Drain the noodles. 
 Set a wok over high heat for 1 minute, then add the oil and heat until almost smoking. 
 Add the garlic and ginger; sauté for 30 seconds. 
 Add the shrimp and sauté until almost cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes.
 Transfer to a plate.
 
 step 3
 Add the noodles and stir-fry for 1 minute.
 Pour in three-quarters of the tamarind sauce and toss to coat the noodles.
 Add more sauce if needed. C
 ook until the noodles are al dente, then push them to one side of the wok and scramble the eggs in the remaining space.
 Add the shrimp, broccoli, carrot, scallions, bean sprouts and half the peanuts.
 Toss to mix. 
 Divide among 4 plates and garnish with the remaining peanuts, the cilantro, lime wedges, sesame seeds and (for brave children) red pepper flakes.
