spicy shrimp tacos with garlic cilantro lime slaw

For the Garlic Cilantro Lime Sauce
¼ cup oil
¼ cup water
½ cup chopped green onions
½ cup cilantro leaves
2-3 cloves garlic (less if you're sensitive to garlicky things)
½ teaspoon salt
juice of 2 limes
½ cup sour cream
For the Shrimp Tacos
1 lb. shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails removed
1 teaspoon each chili powder, cumin, and southwestern seasoning (see notes)
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (more or less to taste)
2-3 cups shredded green cabbage
8 small corn tortillas
1-2 avocados
Cotija cheese and additional cilantro for topping
lime wedges for serving
INSTRUCTIONS
Pulse all the sauce ingredients except the sour cream in a food processor. When mostly smooth, add the sour cream and pulse until combined. Taste and adjust as needed. Set aside.
Heat a drizzle of oil a large skillet over medium high heat. Pat the shrimp dry with paper towels and sprinkle with the spices. Add the shrimp to the hot pan and saute for 5-8 minutes, flipping occasionally, until the shrimp are cooked through.
Toss some of the sauce (not all) with the cabbage until it the cabbage is coated to your liking. It should resemble a coleslaw - you want it to be enough sauce so the cabbage is weighed down a little bit. Use leftover sauce on top of the tacos or in other recipes.
To serve tacos, smash a spoonful of avocado on the tortillas, top with a few pieces of shrimp, top with coleslaw, and finish with Cotjia cheese, cilantro, and lime wedges.
NOTES
For the three spices, I used chili powder, cumin, and a store bought southwestern seasoning mix. I would say the chili powder and the cumin are must-haves for the color and flavor, but then just add whatever else you like or have in your spice cabinet from there. If you don't have a seasoning mix that's salted, be sure to add salt and pepper.

For a variation, try frying the shrimp using the beer batter instructions in this recipe. Takes more time, but SO good!
